# Background
I was approached by the Human Resource department at my employer and was asked if there was a way to auotomate the creation of drivers in the BP Fuel Card iConnect ComData system.  The goal was to create a means by which any driver that joined the organization was issued a pin code to use any fuel card in the BP Fuel card program.  I split my solution into two pieces.
1. A module which contained functions to connect to the ComData system (PSComData)
1. A script triggered nightly to process through the HR records and make necessary updates.
The code found in this repository is the module I created (PSComData)
